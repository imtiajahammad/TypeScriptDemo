  - A component-based framework for building scalable app
  - Provided collection of libraries to cover features like Routing, Forms
  
  # Frameworks
  - Framework generally contains set of libraries
  - You can extend the frameworks
  - Some example are Angular, .Net, Ionic, ExpressJS
 
# Libraries
  - Libraries generally perform specific operation
  - You can combine multiple libs to build apps

 # Introduction to TypeScript
  - A strongly typed Programming Language
  - Created and maintained by Microsoft
  - Superset of JavaScript
  
 # Why TypeScript?
  - Compiles to JavaScript
  - Keeps your code evergreen
  - Supported by all major libraries and frameworks
  
  # Type Safety
    - Keeps your application free from Type Errors
    - Languages like C#, Java are example of Type Safe Language
    - Keeps your JS code free from undefined and null values
    - In TypeScript Types are stripped when your code is converted to JS
    
  # Installing and Creating First TypeScript Program
    - Install Node
		- Use Latest version of NodeJs
		- 'npm init' to create a package.json
		- Install TypeScript 'npm i typescript'
		- Initialize TypeScript
		- 'tsc --init'
  
  
  
  
  
  
  # WORKFLOW
  - Check if node is installed, otherwise install node
  - Create a folder and open the folder in Visual Studio Code
  - Open the terminal in VSCode and use `npm init` (this will create a package.json file)
  - Install TypeScript by using `npm i typescript` in the folder on the terminal (this will fetch the node packages into the folder)
  - Use `tsc --init` in the terminal to tsconfig.json file in the folder on the terminal
  
  
  - In the 'tscconfig.json' file, update the value for 'target' to "ES2015"
